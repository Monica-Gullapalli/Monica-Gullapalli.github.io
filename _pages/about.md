Hi, I am Monica Gullapalli, an ongoing Master of Science in Computer Science student at the University of Colorado Boulder.


I am deeply interested in building web apps using AI, Machine Learning, Neural Networks, Deep Learning, and Natural Language Processing. I tend to use different tech stacks while doing so, including but not limited to Python and MERN. I am well-versed with Django, Flask, Jinja, SQL, SQLite3, and Java for Android app development.

I am also interested in UI Design and Development and work on it along with my other ventures. I have a knack for graphic designing too.

Nice to meet you, keep exploring! Hope this helps.
